### Overview

The platform aims to provide users with a virtual test environment that replicates real test scenarios while offering personalization options to cater to individual needs. Although primarily targeted at students and teachers, the platform is accessible to anyone in need of its assessment solution.

- the Back-end facing REST API server 
that communicate with each other to form the complete Mock Test Conducting System.

The Front-end Client is developed using popular modern Javascript framework React and the backend REST API would be developed using popular Python web framework Django. The REST API allows for efflicient communication between the frontend application and the backend application.
The application has been hosted online on a free tier server. The site can be accessed at:
